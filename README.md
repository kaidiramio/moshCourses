These are courses via "Mosh coding made simple" that I've either completed or am working on in my own free time, on my own. 

## Completed Courses: 

JavaScript, Node.js, 

## Working on:

React, Java, Data Structures and Algos

## Reflections:

Mosh has been a solid addition to my learning and that's what I have been really honing in on to work on my fundamentals.
